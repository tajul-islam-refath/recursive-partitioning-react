# React Recursive Partition

## Features

- Clicking the 'V' button split the partition vertically, and clicking the 'H' button split it horizontally. Each split should create two new partitions, one retaining the original color and the other with a new random color.
- The component allow removing any partition using a button (e.g., '-').
- Partitions are resizable by dragging their borders.
